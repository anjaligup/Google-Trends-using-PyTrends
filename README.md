# Google-Trends-using-PyTrends

First data science-y project. Used pandas and pytrends (A google trend API) to explore different functions and create different requests such as what days was the keyword most searched, sorting my region of keyword search etc. 

Things I learned:
- A payload is data you are sending to API (kinda like a request), you can build a payload using pytrends .build_payload() function
- I can use matplotlib (a data visualization tool in Python) to create some cool bar graphs from the data I acquire from the payload response
- 'fivethirtyeight' is a default graph style
- .DataFrame() is a constructor class in pandas is a 2-D structure with rows and columns; data must be given as a param
